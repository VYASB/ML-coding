# Why use this template?

<i>Eyecandy display for your training curves in the terminal!</i>
</div>
<br>

It is intented to quickly bootstrap a PyTorch project with all the **necessary**
boilerplate that one typically writes in every project. We give you all the *bells and whistles* so
you can focus on what matters.

<h3><i>Key ideas:</i></h3>

- Keep it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and repeatable with
	[Hydra-Zen](https://mit-ll-responsible-ai.github.io/hydra-zen/index.html).
- Raw PyTorch for maximum flexibility and transparency.
- Minimal abstraction and opacity but focus on extensibility.
- The sweet spot between a template and a framework.
    - The bare minimum boilerplate is taken care of but not hidden away.
    - You are free to do whatever you want, everything is transparent.
	- Provides base classes for datasets, trainer, etc. to make it easier to get started and provide
      good structure for DRY code and easy debugging.
    - Provides a set of defaults for the most common use cases.
    - Provides a set of tools to make it easier to debug and visualize.
	- Provides all the [bells and whistles](https://github.com/DubiousCactus/bells-and-whistles) to
		make your programming experience *fun*!

### Why this one?

While the [lightning-hydra-template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template) is clean,
mature, highly functional and comes with all the features you could ever want, I find that because
of all the abstraction it actually becomes a hindrance when writing research code. Unless you know
the template on the tip of your fingers, it's too much hassle to look for the right file, the right
method where you have to put your code. And PyTorch Lightning? Great for building stuff, not so
much for researching new training pipelines or working with custom data loading.

## Features

- **DRY configuration with [Hydra-Zen](https://mit-ll-responsible-ai.github.io/hydra-zen/index.html)**: painlessly configure experiments and swap whole groups with
    the CLI, simpler and DRYier than Hydra!
- **Run isolation and experiment reproducibility**: Hydra isolates each of your run and saves a
    YAML file of your config so you can always backtrack in your ML experiments.
- **Gorgeous terminal UI**: no more waiting for the slow Weights&Biases UI to load and sync,
    the curves are in your terminal (thanks to [Plotext](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext/))! An informative and good-looking progress bar lets you know
    just what you need to know.
- **[Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai) integration**: of course, take advantage of WANDB when your code is ready to
    be launched into orbit.
- **Best-n model saver**: automatically deletes obsolete models from earlier epochs and only keeps
 the N best validation models on disk!
- **Automatic loading of the best model from a run name**: no need to look for that good model
    file, just pass the run name that was generated for you. They have cool and colorful names :)
- **SIGINT handler**: waits for the end of the epoch and validation to terminate the programm if
     CTRL+C is pressed.

```

## Setting up

1. Set up a virtual environment and activate it.
2. [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/) for your system.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run `pre-commit install` to setup the pre-commit hooks. These will run [Black](), [Isort](),
[Autoflake]() and others to clean up your code.

## Usage

A typical way of using this template is to follow these steps:

1. Implement your dataset loader (look at `datqaset/example.py`)
2. Configure it (look at the `dataset` section in `conf/experiment.py`)
3. Implement your model (look at `model/example.py`)
4. Configure it (look at the `model` section in `conf/experiment.py`)
5. Configure your entire experiment(s) in `conf/experiment.py`.
6. Implement `_train_val_iteration()` in `src/base_trainer.py`.

To run an experiment, use `./train.py +experiment=my_experiment`.

You may experiment on the fly with `./train.py dataset=my_dataset data_loader.batch_size=32 model.latent_dim=128 training.epochs=30 training.viz_every=5`.

To evaluate a model, run `test.py testing.load_from_run=<run_name_from_previous_training>`.


You can always look at what's available in your config with `./train.py --help` or `./test.py
--help`!


### Configuring your experiments & project

This template comes with an example dataset and model that are pre-configured in
`conf/experiment.py` using
[hydra-zen](https://mit-ll-responsible-ai.github.io/hydra-zen/index.html). To learn how to adapt it
to your project, you may refer to their
[documentation](https://mit-ll-responsible-ai.github.io/hydra-zen/api_reference.html) and
[tutorials](https://mit-ll-responsible-ai.github.io/hydra-zen/tutorials.html).

In addition, you can configure the behaviour of the training logic as well as other settings by
setting project-level constants in `conf/project.py`, such as the name of your project (i.e. for
[wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai)).

<details><summary>You can override most project-level constants at runtime using environment variables!</summary>

```
$ PLOT_ENABLED=false REPRODUCIBLE=0 ./train.py +experiment=my_experiment
```

</p>
</details>


### Logging and repeatability

Each of your run creates a folder with its name in `runs/`. You can find there the used YAML
config, the checkpoints and any other file you wish to save.

## Core logic

The core of this template is implemented in `src/base_trainer.py`:
```python
class BaseTrainer:
    def __init__(
        self,
        model: torch.nn.Module,
        opt: Optimizer,
        train_loader: DataLoader,

## Roadmap
 - [x] Torchmetrics: this takes care of batching the loss and averaging it
 - [x] Saving top 3 best val models (easily configure metric)
 - [x] Training + evaluation loop
 - [x] Wandb integration with predefined logging metrics
 - [x] Automatic instantiation for the optimizer, scheduler, model
 - [x] The best progress display I can ever get!! (kinda like torchlightning template? But I want
 colour (as in PIP), I want to see my hydra conf, and I want to see a little graph in a curses style in real
 time (look into Rich, Textual, etc.).
 - [x] Interception of SIGKILL, SIGTERM to stop training but save everything: two behaviours (1
 will be the default ofc) -- a) wait for epoch end and validation, b) abort epoch.
 - [x] Add git hooks for linting, formatting, etc.
 - [x] Training logic
 - [x] Generate random run name (human readble from words)
 - [x] Automatic model loading from run name
 - [x] Test logic
 - [x] requirements.txt
 - [ ] Tests?
 - [ ] Feedback & improvements
 - [ ] Refactor what is necessary (UI stuff)
 - [ ] Make datasets highly reproducible to the max (masterplan):
	 - [ ] Hash the dataset post-instantiation (iterate and hash) and log to wandb.
	 - [ ] Log the date of creation of all files (log anomalies like one date sticking out)
	 - [ ] ???
